*** Assorted to-do items and random thoughts *** IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER ***

Ability to remove an sth from the prepare_cached cache.
	$sth->uncache;
and	$dbh->uncache; for connect_cached
implies duplication of key key code or iterate through cache.
$h->uncache and/or option to prepare_cache to discard (and replace)
cached $sth if it's still active. Or weak refs?

Add PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for multiplicity/threads?
And enable xsbypass if possible.

Perhaps $h->{PrintWarn} $h->{RaiseWarn} $h->{HandleWarn}
or better still, a more general event mechanism
but one that makes the above very easy: $h->{HandleEvent}
but need to classify 'events'. At least SUCCESS_WITH_INFO
(which covers eg mysql warnings), and something for 'messages'
from the server while exevuting stored procedures.

$dbh->ping($skip_seconds) - skip the ping if ping'd less than $skip_seconds ago
Change connect_cached to use ping($skip_seconds || 10);

Polish up and document _dbtype_names with an external interface and using get_info.

$sth->{ParamTypes} eg { "1" => SQL_VARCHAR, "2" => { TYPE=>SQL_VARCHAR, ora_type=>99 }};

Give handles names: $h->{Id} ?
Useful for reporting, Multiplex, DBD::AnyData etc etc
May become useful for weakrefs etc

Add architecture info to DBI and DBI::DBD build messages so
users error reports are more useful.

$dbh->get_inner_handle / set_inner_handle
		use to make $dbh->connect return same handle
Hook to call code ref on each fetch, pass fbav ref
datarow_array(), datarow_arrayref(), datarow_hashref()
remove sth from prepare_cached cache.

DBI->setup_driver alias for _setup_driver, and make idempotent.

Devel::Leak

DBIx::DWIW

The DBI needs some standard way to handle the 'success with info' concept:
	$h->{HandleEvent}

Maybe have fetchrow_arrayref return not a new reference to the same
array each time, but the same reference to the same array each time.
That would save a new/mortal/free for each row. Need to consider
safety in case application assigns to the ref etc. Could sanity
check in get_fbav that SvRV still points to the row array.
But maybe it's not worth it if perl's "tmp stealing" works for refs.

DBI::Profile: add simple way to normalise the sql (convert constants
to placeholders) so profiling is more effective for drivers/applications
which don't use placeholders.

DBI::Profile: Add calc of approx XS method call and timing overhead
by calling perl_call("DBI::dbi_time") at boot time for profile, and
add to each sample.

Sort out DBIcDBISTATE() and DBIS mess

fetchall_hashref: may be better to call (the optimized) fetchall_arrayref
then convert to hashes

Sponge behave_like - generalize?

Update DBI::DBD with overview (at least) recommend Driver.xst strongly.
Find XS drivers that don't use it and talk to authors.
Ship separate DBD::TemplateP and DBD::TemplateXS drivers as examples.

Check: local($h->{PrintError})=0; resets $DBI::errstr at end of scope?

Add UnimpMethodHook (in XS)
Test and integrate with DProf?
FetchHashReuse attrib (=1 or ={}) copy from dbh to sth.
Record attrib STOREs so can be replayed (or use subclass?)

Merge/document  DBIx::AnyDBD functionality into the DBI

make lasth return outer handle

Add $h->swap_internal_handle($other_h)

Add a C call to return boolean for is a number' for a given SV.
Needs to do the right thing for a non-numeric string SV that's been
tested in a numeric context (eg $a='S23'; foo() if $a==-1; $sth->execute($a))
So if SvNVOK is true but the value is 0 then should also do looks_like_number()
to be sure.

Rename finish to discard_pending_rows :-) [or just add an alias and docs :-]
Or maybe to 'close' (the ODBC equiv)

add details of the DBI book to the docs
test shell /connect user etc

document dbi_fetchall_arrayref_attr attr of selectall_arrayref().

Count execute()s (and do's?) (in ima struct? not thread safe).
Reset count in commit/rollback.
In $dbh->DESTROY don't issue warning if count == 0.

#define a large negative number to mean 'error' from st_execute and
change *.xst to treat eaither that or -2 as an error. (The -2 is
a transition or old drivers.)

ODBC 3.5 date and intervals types and subtypes (from unixODBC?)

Proxy: allow config to speficy SQL to allow/deny via regexen
Docs for connect_cached and test with proxy.

BINDING:

Add to docs & tutorial re wrong bind type on a param may cause
index to not be used! (Find real examples first)

> And note that if you are using bind_param_inout as 'bind_param_by_ref',
> then the $maxlen parameter is redundant.  I suspect all drivers could

Okay. I'll take that as a vote for bind_param_by_ref as an alias for
bind_param_inout. >>todo.

LOGGING:

Seperate log for sql statements?

Add per-handle debug file pointer (or at least a macro that _looks_ like that).
Or, better yet, a function pointer so we can do more clever things.
Maybe also need to add locking to prevent file contents being mangled
by multiple threads/interpreters (esp mod_perl v2 and ActivePerl).

OTHERS:

Enable warnings in default_user().
Add prompt for user/pass in default_user()?

Change bind_column to save the info for get_fbav to use when
first called. Thus making bind before execute work for all drivers.

Add a handle flag to say that the driver has a hash that maps error
codes into SQLSTATE values. The error event mechanism could check for
the flag and lookup the SQLSTATE value for the error from the hash.

ODBC attribute defining if transactions are supported
http://www.vpservices.com/jeff/programs/SQL/docs/odbc-getinfo-msdn.html

$dbh-level __WARN__ and __DIE__. Initially just provide DBIXS hooks
for DBD's to use (and pass h and imp_xxh to). Thus $dbh can redirect
errors etc from all children in one go.

Informix inspired changes.

Add hook to DBI::DBD to write a myconfig.txt file into the
source directory containing key driver and config info.

attribute for 'last inserted id'?

test suite
http://www.mipt.sw.ru/en/products/ots/

$sth->more_results, now and $sth->become($sth2) later

dbish - state AutoCommit status clearly at connect time.
(And try to set AutoCommit off in eval?)

Add thread CV locks (not method locks)
to &DBI::connect and &DBI::connect_cached
in xs dbi_init code.

fetch_scroll handling via get_fbav.
Also add:
	getrow_array       (or getdata_?)
	getrow_arrayref?
	getrow_hashref?

test that $dbh->do will RaiseError
RaiseError in %attr - doc it not working - hints.

Consider making all SQL_ known to the DBI. Want to check for
valid spelling. Also would like C<exists $h->{Attrib}> to
work. Maybe auto load a module that defines a private hash
that just serves to list known attributes.
Or DBI->SQL_FOO and/or DBI::SQL_FOO.

check out http://tegan.deltanet.com/~phlip/DBUIframe.html

Auto proxying for individual drivers: DBI_PROXY_foo=...
Else more generic dsn-rewrite via env vars

Check DBD::Proxy connect&fetch latency (e.g. CGI use).

Add SCALE to DBD::Sponge

Rework handle creation for
$h->clone ?, and maybe
$dbh->connect([$user, $passwd])	# to reconnect, possibly as a different user

Add (ODBC) attribute to indicate if placeholders are supported.
http://www.vpservices.com/jeff/programs/SQL/docs/odbc-getinfo-msdn.html

Fix shared error codes between (dbh) handles, maybe.

Add problem reporting info to DBI.pm

Add 'break handling' when field values change? Use two fbav's so 'previous
record' is available. Define break fields and handlers. Call them via
an alternate fetch_with_break method.
Jan 2002: Also now see DBIx::FetchLoop (Brendan Fagan)

Umm, it looks like $dbh->{SQL_ACTIVE_STATEMENTS} would be the one.
It defines the max number of statements that can be active on a
the $dbh. 0 means unknown or no specific limit.
I'll add that to the DBI and DBI spec.

I think drivers that emulate multiple active statements using an
implicit extra dbh but that can't tie the commit/rollback on the
'parent' dbh to the child should probably still set
SQL_ACTIVE_STATEMENTS to just 1. Or maybe 1.1, or 2. I'm open to
suggestion on that one.

Umm. I see what you mean. It's reasonable to assume that a driver
will 'freeze' the value of applicable attributes at prepare or execute
time. The driver should probably document that kind of thing.

I think the DBI's template .xst file will probably grow some code
to handle attributes to prepare semi-automatically, sometime.

Tim.

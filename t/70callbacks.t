=for comment XXX

The big problem here is that conceptually the Callbacks attribute
is applied to the $dbh _during_ the $drh->connect() call, so you can't
set a callback on "connect" on the $dbh because connect isn't called
on the dbh, but on the $drh.

So a "connect" callback would have to be defined on the $drh, but that's
cumbersome for the user and then it would apply to all future connects
using that driver.

The best thing to do is probably to special-case "connect", "connect_cached"
and (the already special-case) "connect_cached.reused".

A generic 'transparent' callback looks like this:
(this assumes only scalar context will be used)

    sub {
        my $h = shift;
        return if our $avoid_deep_recursion->{"$h $_"}++;
        my $this = $h->$_(@_);
        undef $_;    # tell DBI not to call original method
        return $this; # tell DBI to return this instead
    };

XXX should add a test for this
XXX even better would be to run chunks of the test suite with that as a '*' callback. In theory everything should pass (except this test file, naturally)..

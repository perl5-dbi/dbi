# Test if a warning can be recorded in the STORE method
# which it couldn't in DBI 1.628
# see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=89015
# This is all started from the fact that the SQLite ODBC Driver cannot set the
# ReadOnly attribute (which is mapped to ODBC SQL_ACCESS_MODE) - it
# legitimately returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO option value changed.
# It was decided that this should record a warning but when it was added to DBD::ODBC
# DBI did not show the warning - keep_err?
# Tim's comment on #dbi was:
#  the dispatcher has logic to notice if ErrCount went up during a call and disables keep_err in that case.
# I think something similar might be needed for err. E.g., "if it's defined now but wasn't defined before" then
# act appropriately.

.SH NAME
DBD::Gofer::Policy::Base \- Base class for DBD::Gofer policies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect("dbi:Gofer:transport=...;policy=...", ...)
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
DBD::Gofer can be configured via a \*(Aqpolicy\*(Aq mechanism that allows you to
fine\-tune the number of round\-trips to the Gofer server.  The policies are
grouped into classes (which may be subclassed) and referenced by the name of
the class.
.PP
The DBD::Gofer::Policy::Base class is the base class for all the policy
classes and describes all the individual policy items.
.PP
The Base policy is not used directly. You should use a policy class derived from it.
.SH "POLICY CLASSES"
.IX Header "POLICY CLASSES"
Three policy classes are supplied with DBD::Gofer:
.PP
DBD::Gofer::Policy::pedantic is most \*(Aqtransparent\*(Aq but slowest because it
makes more  round\-trips to the Gofer server.
.PP
DBD::Gofer::Policy::classic is a reasonable compromise \- it\*(Aqs the default policy.
.PP
DBD::Gofer::Policy::rush is fastest, but may require code changes in your applications.
.PP
Generally the default \f(CW\*(C`classic\*(C'\fR policy is fine. When first testing an existing
application with Gofer it is a good idea to start with the \f(CW\*(C`pedantic\*(C'\fR policy
first and then switch to \f(CW\*(C`classic\*(C'\fR or a custom policy, for final testing.
.SH "POLICY ITEMS"
.IX Header "POLICY ITEMS"
These are temporary docs: See the source code for list of policies and their defaults.
.PP
In a future version the policies and their defaults will be defined in the pod and parsed out at load\-time.
.PP
See the source code to this module for more details.
.SH "POLICY CUSTOMIZATION"
.IX Header "POLICY CUSTOMIZATION"
XXX This area of DBD::Gofer is subject to change.
.PP
There are three ways to customize policies:
.PP
Policy classes are designed to influence the overall behaviour of DBD::Gofer
with existing, unaltered programs, so they work in a reasonably optimal way
without requiring code changes. You can implement new policy classes as
subclasses of existing policies.
.PP
In many cases individual policy items can be overridden on a case\-by\-case basis
within your application code. You do this by passing a corresponding
\&\f(CW\*(C`<go_<policy_name\*(C'\fR>> attribute into DBI methods by your application code.
This lets you fine\-tune the behaviour for special cases.
.PP
The policy items are implemented as methods. In many cases the methods are
passed parameters relating to the DBD::Gofer code being executed. This means
the policy can implement dynamic behaviour that varies depending on the
particular circumstances, such as the particular statement being executed.

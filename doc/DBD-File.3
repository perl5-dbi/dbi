.SH NAME
DBD::File \- Base class for writing file based DBI drivers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
This module is a base class for writing other DBDs.
It is not intended to function as a DBD itself (though it is possible).
If you want to access flat files, use DBD::AnyData, or
DBD::CSV (both of which are subclasses of DBD::File).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The DBD::File module is not a true DBI driver, but an abstract
base class for deriving concrete DBI drivers from it. The implication
is, that these drivers work with plain files, for example CSV files or
INI files. The module is based on the SQL::Statement
module, a simple SQL engine.
.PP
See DBI for details on DBI, SQL::Statement for
details on SQL::Statement and DBD::CSV, DBD::DBM
or DBD::AnyData for example drivers.
.SS Metadata

The following attributes are handled by DBI itself and not by DBD::File,
thus they all work as expected:

\fIDBD::File specific attributes\fR
.IX Subsection "DBD::File specific attributes"
.PP
In addition to the DBI attributes, you can use the following dbh
attributes:
.PP
f_dir
.IX Subsection "f_dir"
.PP
This attribute is used for setting the directory where the files are
opened and it defaults to the current directory (\fI.\fR). Usually you set
it on the dbh but it may be overridden per table (see f_meta).
.PP
When the value for \f(CW\*(C`f_dir\*(C'\fR is a relative path, it is converted into
the appropriate absolute path name (based on the current working
directory) when the dbh attribute is set.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  f_dir => "/data/foo/csv",
.Ve
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`f_dir\*(C'\fR is set to a non\-existing location, the connection will fail.
See CVE\-2014\-10401 for reasoning. Because of this, folders to use cannot
be created after the connection, but must exist before the connection is
initiated.
.PP
See "KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS".
.PP
f_dir_search
.IX Subsection "f_dir_search"
.PP
This optional attribute can be set to pass a list of folders to also
find existing tables. It will \fBnot\fR be used to create new files.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  f_dir_search => [ "/data/bar/csv", "/dump/blargh/data" ],
.Ve
.PP
f_ext
.IX Subsection "f_ext"
.PP
This attribute is used for setting the file extension. The format is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  extension{/flag}
.Ve
.PP
where the /flag is optional and the extension is case\-insensitive.
\&\f(CW\*(C`f_ext\*(C'\fR allows you to specify an extension which:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  f_ext => ".csv/r",
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
makes DBD::File prefer \fItable.extension\fR over \fItable\fR.
.IP \(bu 4
makes the table name the filename minus the extension.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv
.Ve
.PP
In the above example and when \f(CW\*(C`f_dir\*(C'\fR contains both \fItable.csv\fR and
\&\fItable\fR, DBD::File will open \fItable.csv\fR and the table will be
named "table". If \fItable.csv\fR does not exist but \fItable\fR does
that file is opened and the table is also called "table".
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`f_ext\*(C'\fR is not specified and \fItable.csv\fR exists it will be opened
and the table will be called "table.csv" which is probably not what
you want.
.PP
NOTE: even though extensions are case\-insensitive, table names are
not.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv/r
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`r\*(C'\fR flag means the file extension is required and any filename
that does not match the extension is ignored.
.PP
Usually you set it on the dbh but it may be overridden per table
(see f_meta).
.PP
f_schema
.IX Subsection "f_schema"
.PP
This will set the schema name and defaults to the owner of the
directory in which the table file resides. You can set \f(CW\*(C`f_schema\*(C'\fR to
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    my $dbh = DBI\->connect ("dbi:CSV:", "", "", {
\&        f_schema => undef,
\&        f_dir    => "data",
\&        f_ext    => ".csv/r",
\&        }) or die $DBI::errstr;
.Ve
.PP
By setting the schema you affect the results from the tables call:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @tables = $dbh\->tables ();
\&
\&    # no f_schema
\&    "merijn".foo
\&    "merijn".bar
\&
\&    # f_schema => "dbi"
\&    "dbi".foo
\&    "dbi".bar
\&
\&    # f_schema => undef
\&    foo
\&    bar
.Ve
.PP
Defining \f(CW\*(C`f_schema\*(C'\fR to the empty string is equal to setting it to \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR
so the DSN can be \f(CW"dbi:CSV:f_schema=;f_dir=."\fR.
.PP
f_lock
.IX Subsection "f_lock"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`f_lock\*(C'\fR attribute is used to set the locking mode on the opened
table files. Note that not all platforms support locking.  By default,
tables are opened with a shared lock for reading, and with an
exclusive lock for writing. The supported modes are:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  0: No locking at all.
\&
\&  1: Shared locks will be used.
\&
\&  2: Exclusive locks will be used.
.Ve
.PP
But see KNOWN BUGS below.
.PP
f_lockfile
.IX Subsection "f_lockfile"
.PP
If you wish to use a lockfile extension other than \f(CW\*(C`.lck\*(C'\fR, simply specify
the \f(CW\*(C`f_lockfile\*(C'\fR attribute:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect ("dbi:DBM:f_lockfile=.foo");
\&  $dbh\->{f_lockfile} = ".foo";
\&  $dbh\->{dbm_tables}{qux}{f_lockfile} = ".foo";
.Ve
.PP
If you wish to disable locking, set the \f(CW\*(C`f_lockfile\*(C'\fR to \f(CW0\fR.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect ("dbi:DBM:f_lockfile=0");
\&  $dbh\->{f_lockfile} = 0;
\&  $dbh\->{dbm_tables}{qux}{f_lockfile} = 0;
.Ve
.PP
f_encoding
.IX Subsection "f_encoding"
.PP
With this attribute, you can set the encoding in which the file is opened.
This is implemented using \f(CW\*(C`binmode $fh, ":encoding(<f_encoding>)"\*(C'\fR.
.PP
f_meta
.IX Subsection "f_meta"
.PP
Private data area aliasing "sql_meta" in DBI::DBD::SqlEngine which
contains information about the tables this module handles. Table meta
data might not be available until the table has been accessed for the
first time e.g., by issuing a select on it however it is possible to
pre\-initialize attributes for each table you use.
.PP
DBD::File recognizes the (public) attributes \f(CW\*(C`f_ext\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`f_dir\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`f_file\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`f_encoding\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`f_lock\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`f_lockfile\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`f_schema\*(C'\fR,
in addition to the attributes "sql_meta" in DBI::DBD::SqlEngine already
supports. Be very careful when modifying attributes you do not know,
the consequence might be a destroyed or corrupted table.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`f_file\*(C'\fR is an attribute applicable to table meta data only and you
will not find a corresponding attribute in the dbh. Whilst it may be
reasonable to have several tables with the same column names, it is
not for the same file name. If you need access to the same file using
different table names, use \f(CW\*(C`SQL::Statement\*(C'\fR as the SQL engine and the
\&\f(CW\*(C`AS\*(C'\fR keyword:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    SELECT * FROM tbl AS t1, tbl AS t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`f_file\*(C'\fR can be an absolute path name or a relative path name but if
it is relative, it is interpreted as being relative to the \f(CW\*(C`f_dir\*(C'\fR
attribute of the table meta data. When \f(CW\*(C`f_file\*(C'\fR is set DBD::File will
use \f(CW\*(C`f_file\*(C'\fR as specified and will not attempt to work out an
alternative for \f(CW\*(C`f_file\*(C'\fR using the \f(CW\*(C`table name\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`f_ext\*(C'\fR
attribute.
.PP
While \f(CW\*(C`f_meta\*(C'\fR is a private and readonly attribute (which means, you
cannot modify it\*(Aqs values), derived drivers might provide restricted
write access through another attribute. Well known accessors are
\&\f(CW\*(C`csv_tables\*(C'\fR for DBD::CSV, \f(CW\*(C`ad_tables\*(C'\fR for DBD::AnyData and
\&\f(CW\*(C`dbm_tables\*(C'\fR for DBD::DBM.

.SH "KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
.IX Header "KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
.IP \(bu 4
This module uses flock () internally but flock is not available on all
platforms. On MacOS and Windows 95 there is no locking at all (perhaps
not so important on MacOS and Windows 95, as there is only a single
user).
.IP \(bu 4
The module stores details about the handled tables in a private area
of the driver handle (\f(CW$drh\fR). This data area is not shared between
different driver instances, so several \f(CW\*(C`DBI\->connect ()\*(C'\fR calls will
cause different table instances and private data areas.
.Sp
This data area is filled for the first time when a table is accessed,
either via an SQL statement or via \f(CW\*(C`table_info\*(C'\fR and is not
destroyed until the table is dropped or the driver handle is released.
Manual destruction is possible via f_clear_meta.

For DBD::CSV tables this means, once opened "foo.csv" as table named "foo",
another table named "foo" accessing the file "foo.txt" cannot be opened.
Accessing "foo" will always access the file "foo.csv" in memorized
\&\f(CW\*(C`f_dir\*(C'\fR, locking \f(CW\*(C`f_lockfile\*(C'\fR via memorized \f(CW\*(C`f_lock\*(C'\fR.

You can use f_clear_meta or the \f(CW\*(C`f_file\*(C'\fR attribute for a specific table
to work around this.

When used with SQL::Statement and temporary tables e.g.,

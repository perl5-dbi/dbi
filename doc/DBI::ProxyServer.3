.SH NAME
DBI::ProxyServer \- a server for the DBD::Proxy driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&    use DBI::ProxyServer;
\&    DBI::ProxyServer::main(@ARGV);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
DBI::Proxy Server is a module for implementing a proxy for the DBI proxy
driver, DBD::Proxy. It allows access to databases over the network if the
DBMS does not offer networked operations. But the proxy server might be
useful for you, even if you have a DBMS with integrated network
functionality: It can be used as a DBI proxy in a firewalled environment.
.PP
DBI::ProxyServer runs as a daemon on the machine with the DBMS or on the
firewall. The client connects to the agent using the DBI driver DBD::Proxy,
thus in the exactly same way than using DBD::mysql, DBD::mSQL or any other
DBI driver.
.PP
The agent is implemented as a RPC::PlServer application. Thus you have
access to all the possibilities of this module, in particular encryption
and a similar configuration file. DBI::ProxyServer adds the possibility of
query restrictions: You can define a set of queries that a client may
execute and restrict access to those. (Requires a DBI driver that supports
parameter binding.) See "CONFIGURATION FILE".
.PP
The provided driver script, dbiproxy, may either be used as it is or
used as the basis for a local version modified to meet your needs.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
When calling the \fBDBI::ProxyServer::main()\fR function, you supply an
array of options. These options are parsed by the Getopt::Long module.
The ProxyServer inherits all of RPC::PlServer\*(Aqs and hence Net::Daemon\*(Aqs
options and option handling, in particular the ability to read
options from either the command line or a config file. See
RPC::PlServer. See Net::Daemon. Available options include
.IP "\fIchroot\fR (\fB\-\-chroot=dir\fR)" 4
.IX Item "chroot (--chroot=dir)"
(UNIX only)  After doing a \fBbind()\fR, change root directory to the given
directory by doing a \fBchroot()\fR. This is useful for security, but it
restricts the environment a lot. For example, you need to load DBI
drivers in the config file or you have to create hard links to Unix
sockets, if your drivers are using them. For example, with MySQL, a
config file might contain the following lines:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    my $rootdir = \*(Aq/var/dbiproxy\*(Aq;
\&    my $unixsockdir = \*(Aq/tmp\*(Aq;
\&    my $unixsockfile = \*(Aqmysql.sock\*(Aq;
\&    foreach $dir ($rootdir, "$rootdir$unixsockdir") {
\&        mkdir 0755, $dir;
\&    }
\&    link("$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile",
\&         "$rootdir$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile");
\&    require DBD::mysql;
\&
\&    {
\&        \*(Aqchroot\*(Aq => $rootdir,
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
If you don\*(Aqt know \fBchroot()\fR, think of an FTP server where you can see a
certain directory tree only after logging in. See also the \-\-group and
\&\-\-user options.
.IP \fIclients\fR 4
.IX Item "clients"
An array ref with a list of clients. Clients are hash refs, the attributes
\&\fIaccept\fR (0 for denying access and 1 for permitting) and \fImask\fR, a Perl
regular expression for the clients IP number or its host name.
.IP "\fIconfigfile\fR (\fB\-\-configfile=file\fR)" 4
.IX Item "configfile (--configfile=file)"
Config files are assumed to return a single hash ref that overrides the
arguments of the new method. However, command line arguments in turn take
precedence over the config file. See the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section
below for details on the config file.
.IP "\fIdebug\fR (\fB\-\-debug\fR)" 4
.IX Item "debug (--debug)"
Turn debugging mode on. Mainly this asserts that logging messages of
level "debug" are created.
.IP "\fIfacility\fR (\fB\-\-facility=mode\fR)" 4
.IX Item "facility (--facility=mode)"
(UNIX only) Facility to use for Sys::Syslog. The default is
\&\fBdaemon\fR.
.IP "\fIgroup\fR (\fB\-\-group=gid\fR)" 4
.IX Item "group (--group=gid)"
After doing a \fBbind()\fR, change the real and effective GID to the given.
This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a privileged port
(<1024), but don\*(Aqt want the server to execute as root. See also
the \-\-user option.
.Sp
GID\*(Aqs can be passed as group names or numeric values.
.IP "\fIlocaladdr\fR (\fB\-\-localaddr=ip\fR)" 4
.IX Item "localaddr (--localaddr=ip)"
By default a daemon is listening to any IP number that a machine
has. This attribute allows one to restrict the server to the given
IP number.
.IP "\fIlocalport\fR (\fB\-\-localport=port\fR)" 4
.IX Item "localport (--localport=port)"
This attribute sets the port on which the daemon is listening. It
must be given somehow, as there\*(Aqs no default.
.IP "\fIlogfile\fR (\fB\-\-logfile=file\fR)" 4
.IX Item "logfile (--logfile=file)"
Be default logging messages will be written to the syslog (Unix) or
to the event log (Windows NT). On other operating systems you need to
specify a log file. The special value "STDERR" forces logging to
stderr. See Net::Daemon::Log for details.
.IP "\fImode\fR (\fB\-\-mode=modename\fR)" 4
.IX Item "mode (--mode=modename)"
The server can run in three different modes, depending on the environment.
.Sp
If you are running Perl 5.005 and did compile it for threads, then the
server will create a new thread for each connection. The thread will
execute the server\*(Aqs \fBRun()\fR method and then terminate. This mode is the
default, you can force it with "\-\-mode=threads".
.Sp
If threads are not available, but you have a working \fBfork()\fR, then the
server will behave similar by creating a new process for each connection.
This mode will be used automatically in the absence of threads or if
you use the "\-\-mode=fork" option.
.Sp
Finally there\*(Aqs a single\-connection mode: If the server has accepted a
connection, he will enter the \fBRun()\fR method. No other connections are
accepted until the \fBRun()\fR method returns (if the client disconnects).
This operation mode is useful if you have neither threads nor \fBfork()\fR,
for example on the Macintosh. For debugging purposes you can force this
mode with "\-\-mode=single".
.IP "\fIpidfile\fR (\fB\-\-pidfile=file\fR)" 4
.IX Item "pidfile (--pidfile=file)"
(UNIX only) If this option is present, a PID file will be created at the
given location. Default is to not create a pidfile.
.IP "\fIuser\fR (\fB\-\-user=uid\fR)" 4
.IX Item "user (--user=uid)"
After doing a \fBbind()\fR, change the real and effective UID to the given.
This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a privileged port
(<1024), but don\*(Aqt want the server to execute as root. See also
the \-\-group and the \-\-chroot options.
.Sp
UID\*(Aqs can be passed as group names or numeric values.
.IP "\fIversion\fR (\fB\-\-version\fR)" 4
.IX Item "version (--version)"
Suppresses startup of the server; instead the version string will
be printed and the program exits immediately.
.SH SHUTDOWN
.IX Header "SHUTDOWN"
DBI::ProxyServer is built on RPC::PlServer which is, in turn, built on Net::Daemon.
.PP
You should refer to Net::Daemon for how to shutdown the server, except that
you can\*(Aqt because it\*(Aqs not currently documented there (as of v0.43).
The bottom\-line is that it seems that there\*(Aqs no support for graceful shutdown.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION FILE"
The configuration file is just that of \fIRPC::PlServer\fR or \fINet::Daemon\fR
with some additional attributes in the client list.
.PP
The config file is a Perl script. At the top of the file you may include
arbitrary Perl source, for example load drivers at the start (useful
to enhance performance), prepare a chroot environment and so on.
.PP
The important thing is that you finally return a hash ref of option
name/value pairs. The possible options are listed above.
.PP
All possibilities of Net::Daemon and RPC::PlServer apply, in particular
.IP "Host and/or User dependent access control" 4
.IX Item "Host and/or User dependent access control"
.PD 0
.IP "Host and/or User dependent encryption" 4
.IX Item "Host and/or User dependent encryption"
.IP "Changing UID and/or GID after binding to the port" 4
.IX Item "Changing UID and/or GID after binding to the port"
.IP "Running in a \fBchroot()\fR environment" 4
.IX Item "Running in a chroot() environment"
.PD
.PP
Additionally the server offers you query restrictions. Suggest the
following client list:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    \*(Aqclients\*(Aq => [
\&        { \*(Aqmask\*(Aq => \*(Aq^admin\e.company\e.com$\*(Aq,
\&          \*(Aqaccept\*(Aq => 1,
\&          \*(Aqusers\*(Aq => [ \*(Aqroot\*(Aq, \*(Aqwwwrun\*(Aq ],
\&        },
\&        {
\&          \*(Aqmask\*(Aq => \*(Aq^admin\e.company\e.com$\*(Aq,
\&          \*(Aqaccept\*(Aq => 1,
\&          \*(Aqusers\*(Aq => [ \*(Aqroot\*(Aq, \*(Aqwwwrun\*(Aq ],
\&          \*(Aqsql\*(Aq => {
\&               \*(Aqselect\*(Aq => \*(AqSELECT * FROM foo\*(Aq,
\&               \*(Aqinsert\*(Aq => \*(AqINSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?, ?)\*(Aq
\&               }
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
then only the users root and wwwrun may connect from admin.company.com,
executing arbitrary queries, but only wwwrun may connect from other
hosts and is restricted to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $sth\->prepare("select");
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $sth\->prepare("insert");
.Ve
.PP
which in fact are "SELECT * FROM foo" or "INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?, ?)".
.SH "Proxyserver Configuration file (bigger example)"
.IX Header "Proxyserver Configuration file (bigger example)"
This section tells you how to restrict a DBI\-Proxy: Not every user from
every workstation shall be able to execute every query.
.PP
There is a perl program "dbiproxy" which runs on a machine which is able
to connect to all the databases we wish to reach. All Perl\-DBD\-drivers must
be installed on this machine. You can also reach databases for which drivers 
are not available on the machine where you run the program querying the 
database, e.g. ask MS\-Access\-database from Linux.
.PP
Create a configuration file "proxy_oracle.cfg" at the dbproxy\-server:

The most important section to control access to your dbi\-proxy is "client=>"
in the file "proxy_oracle.cfg":
.PP
Controlling which person at which machine is allowed to access
.IP \(bu 4
"mask" is a perl regular expression against the plain ip\-address of the machine which wishes to connect _or_ the reverse\-lookup from a nameserver.
.IP \(bu 4
"accept" tells the dbiproxy\-server whether ip\-adresse like in "mask" are allowed to connect or not (0/1)
.IP \(bu 4
"users" is a reference to a list of usernames which must be matched, this is NOT a regular expression.
.PP
Controlling which SQL\-statements are allowed
.PP
You can put every SQL\-statement you like in simply omitting "sql => ...", but the more important thing is to restrict the connection so that only allowed queries are possible.
.PP
If you include an sql\-section in your config\-file like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        sql => {
\&                alive => \*(Aqselect count(*) from dual\*(Aq,
\&                statistic_area => \*(Aqselect count(*) from e01admin.e01e203 where geb_bezei like ?\*(Aq,
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
The user is allowed to put two queries against the dbi\-proxy. The queries are _not_ "select count(*)...", the queries are "alive" and "statistic_area"! These keywords are replaced by the real query. So you can run a query for "alive":
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        my $sql = "alive";
\&        my $cur = $dbh\->prepare($sql);
\&        ...
.Ve
.PP
The flexibility is that you can put parameters in the where\-part of the query so the query are not static. Simply replace a value in the where\-part of the query through a question mark and bind it as a parameter to the query.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        my $sql = "statistic_area";
\&        my $cur = $dbh\->prepare($sql);
\&        $cur\->bind_param(1,\*(Aq905%\*(Aq);
\&        # A second parameter would be called like this:
\&        # $cur\->bind_param(2,\*(Aq98%\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
The result is this query:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        select count(*) from e01admin.e01e203 
\&        where geb_bezei like \*(Aq905%\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Don\*(Aqt try to put parameters into the sql\-query like this:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        # Does not work like you think.
\&        # Only the first word of the query is parsed,
\&        # so it\*(Aqs changed to "statistic_area", the rest is omitted.
\&        # You _have_ to work with $cur\->bind_param.
\&        my $sql = "statistic_area 905%";
\&        my $cur = $dbh\->prepare($sql);
\&        ...

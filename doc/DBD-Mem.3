.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
DBD::Mem is a database management system that works right out of the box.
If you have a standard installation of Perl and DBI you can begin creating,
accessing, and modifying simple database tables without any further modules.
You can add other modules (e.g., SQL::Statement) for improved functionality.
.PP
DBD::Mem doesn\*(Aqt store any data persistently \- all data has the lifetime of
the instantiated \f(CW$dbh\fR. The main reason to use DBD::Mem is to use extended
features of SQL::Statement where temporary tables are required. One can
use DBD::Mem to simulate \f(CW\*(C`VIEWS\*(C'\fR or sub\-queries.
.PP
Bundling \f(CW\*(C`DBD::Mem\*(C'\fR with DBI will allow us further compatibility checks
of DBI::DBD::SqlEngine beyond the capabilities of DBD::File and
DBD::DBM. This will ensure DBI provided basis for drivers like
DBD::AnyData2 or DBD::Amazon are better prepared and tested for
not\-file based backends.
.SS Metadata
.IX Subsection "Metadata"
There\*(Aqre no new meta data introduced by \f(CW\*(C`DBD::Mem\*(C'\fR. See
"Metadata" in DBI::DBD::SqlEngine for full description.
.SH "GETTING HELP, MAKING SUGGESTIONS, AND REPORTING BUGS"
.IX Header "GETTING HELP, MAKING SUGGESTIONS, AND REPORTING BUGS"
If you need help installing or using DBD::Mem, please write to the DBI
users mailing list at <mailto:dbi\-users@perl.org> or to the
comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup on usenet.  I cannot always answer
every question quickly but there are many on the mailing list or in
the newsgroup who can.
.PP
DBD developers for DBD\*(Aqs which rely on DBI::DBD::SqlEngine or DBD::Mem or
use one of them as an example are suggested to join the DBI developers
mailing list at <mailto:dbi\-dev@perl.org> and strongly encouraged to join our
IRC channel at <irc://irc.perl.org/dbi>.
.PP
If you have suggestions, ideas for improvements, or bugs to report, please
report a bug as described in DBI. Do not mail any of the authors directly,
you might not get an answer.
.PP
When reporting bugs, please send the output of \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->mem_versions($table)\*(C'\fR
for a table that exhibits the bug and as small a sample as you can make of
the code that produces the bug.  And of course, patches are welcome, too
:\-).
.PP
If you need enhancements quickly, you can get commercial support as
described at <http://dbi.perl.org/support/> or you can contact Jens Rehsack
at rehsack@cpan.org for commercial support.
